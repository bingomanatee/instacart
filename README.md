# InstaCart Canada

This is a sample Canadian themed user wizard.

It uses react-md for most UI elements and freactal for style.
Neutrino.js was used as the overall build environment and react router
for the page navigation.

There are still a lot of "holes" in the user flow, but its a timegated test so...

To run it you must:

1. download this repo
2. have Node version 8.9 (prob. any 8.x would do)
3. `npm i` to install the packages.

run `npm run start` to start the build. It will take a while to start up.
When it has compiled the app should run at `localhost:5000`.

Sorry if it doesn't.
